Programs written in Java and Python

To run, use "./runHimmelblau.sh" from the "src/" directory. 

I had to use "chmod u+x runHimmelblau.sh" to make it executable on my system. Not sure if that transfers once submitted or it will need to be made executable again. 

"runHimmelblau.sh" should be run from the "src" folder for the file paths to work correctly.

The graphs are written in python using matplotlib, my python version is 3.7 and it runs fine. The "runHimmelblau.sh" file should handle calling the java and python files.

The main java program requires that it can write to a file for the python program to read and plot.
